This project demonstrates how to create a "Clock Wipe" animation using a CAShapeLayer and a CABasicAnimation.

It creates and installs a CAShapeLayer as a mask on an image view's content layer. The shape layer contains a full-circle arc with a line thickness that is half as wide as the diagonal measure of the image view, so stroking the arc completely fills the image view's bounds.
